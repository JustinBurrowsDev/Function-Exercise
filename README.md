# Challenges I Faced?

Understanding JavaScript functions and where and when to pass in parameters has become a little esoteric. I thinking programmatically can be challenging as well.

# How I overcame? 

When I write things out on a whiteboard so I can see the overall logical process of the entire program before I start coding helps me out a lot and by doing research on platforms like Google, Github YouTube, MDN docs, Stack Overflow, online courses, and reference guides I was able to understand and complete this task.


# What did I learned? 

* How to break down a simple problem programmatically 
* How to understand and use JavaScript functions
* How to use JavaScript parameters
* How to use the `return` keyword
